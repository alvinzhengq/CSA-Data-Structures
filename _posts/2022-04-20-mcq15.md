## Corrections:

### Question 27

Sort is a selection sort, meaning at each iteration the smallest element will be moved to front of the current unsorted subarray by swapping with whatever element is currently at the beginning of the unsorted subarray.

Therefore, the array should progress like this during first three iterations:

1. {1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6}
2. {1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6}
3. {1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 6}

Correct Answer: **B**


### Question 28

For comparisons, it is located inside a nested for loop, and counting the iterations the nested for loop will iterate 15 times (5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1).

For swaps, it is located inside the outer for loop, and the outer for loop itereates 6-1 = 5 times.

Correct Answer: **B**


### Question 37

II and III will work.

II simply starts at the back of the array and adds to the result until startIndex is reached.

III reverses the array and iterates size-startIndex-1 number of times whilst adding to result.

Correct Answer: **E**


### Question 38

Function recursively iterates through the array looking for v in nums, incrementing when it is found. Therefore it is trying to find number of elements equal to val.

Correct Answer: **C**


### Question 39

Setting an element in an ArrayList returns current element there, therefore code is first printing out everything in ArrayList and then printing out ArrayList after modification.

Correct Answer: **C**
