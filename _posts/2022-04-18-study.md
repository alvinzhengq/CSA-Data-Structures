## Overview

The following will be my weekly study plan for the upcoming AP Computer Science A Exam. This will be updated weekly to reflect that week's plan, all the way up until the exam itself in May.


#### Week 1 - 04/18

- **Monday**: Absent.

- **Tuesday**: Take 2015 MC during class, review questions I was confused on afterwards.

- **Wednesday**: Correct 2015 MC fully, reviewing all missed questions and noting down topics I am weak on.

- **Thursday**: Take 2015 FRQ during class, begin reviewing the list of topics I feel I am weak on.

- **Friday**: Correct 2015 FRQ fully, and note down areas in which I need improvement, adding onto list of weak topics.
