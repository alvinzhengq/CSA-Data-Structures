## Corrections:

### Question 9

`.set` and `.add` is specified with `(index, value)`, not `(value, index)` as I orignally assumed.

Correct Answer: **B**


### Question 12

`!borrower.equals(null)` would not work because if `borrower` was null to begin with, than calling `.equals` would result in a null pointer error.

Correct Answer: **B**


### Question 17

Did not account for the initial power level passed to the constructor, which should have been added to the amount specified in the method call.

Correct Answer: **D**


### Question 19

`x` is equal to the sum of all elements in the matrix, with the first number of every row being doubled. Therefore `x = 2 + 2 + 3 + 8 + 5 + 6 = 26`

Correct Answer: **D**


### Question 28

Iteration 1:
`   a = "si" + " the song"`
`   x = 9`

Iteration 2:
`   a = "si the so" + ""`
`   b = -1`

Returned: `"si the so"`

Correct Answer: **B**


### Question 31

```java
int counter = 0; 
for (int i : nums) {   
    if (nums[i] < 0)    
    {       
        counter++;    
    } 
}
```

Above code is incorrect because it attempts to use values as index.

Correct Answer: **A**


### Question 32

An instance of ClassB is being created and stored into a variable of type ClassA, thus when called it is an instance of ClassB being called. Thus the output is `B`.

Correct Answer: **B**


### Question 33

Loop is iterating through columns first, then rows. This means elements are being printed out per column, not per row.

Correct Answer: **E**


### Question 34

Size of ArrayList is being reevaulated every loop, therefore out of bounds will never occur. But when removing elements, we are still incrementing `i`, meaning elements will be skipped due to the next element taking the current index when the current element is removed.

Correct Answer: **E**


### Question 36

Options A-C are all false, since when a is smaller than b, `methodTwo` will always run at least once whereas `methodOne` will not. Therefore, `a%b == 0` guarantees that `a > b`, and being divisible ensures both method have same behavior. 

Correct Answer: **D**


### Question 37

`num2 < num3` means that `num2` will never equal `num3`, therefore the range is from `num2` to `num3` exclusive at the end.

Correct Answer: **E**


### Question 38

Both I and II are valid choices for iterating through an ArrayList and calling methods on the object.

Correct Answer: **D**


### Question 39

Method will only ever return true when each letter in the string is alphabetically larger than the next.

Correct Answer: **D**


### Question 40

Even though both variables store an instance of object `B`, removing `message` from `A` will result in variables of type `A` to not have a method with a signature of `message`, therefore line 3 will fail.

Correct Answer: **A**
