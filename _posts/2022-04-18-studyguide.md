## My Personal Study Guide for the AP CSA Exam

### Red Topics (Topics Needing Immediate Review):

- Dynamic Binding
    - `Vehicle v = new Car();`, is an example of Dynamic Binding which will use Car's methods unless overriden. 
- Inheritance (Super Classes)
    - `class Child extends Parent`, child classes will inherit all of parent's methods.
- Insertion, Bubble, Merge, Selection Sort
- De Morgan's Law
- Static, Final, etc. (Important Keywords)
    - `static` indicates a variable/method that will remain the same regardless of instance of class (Object).
    - `final` indicates a method/variable that cannot be overriden in a class.
- Pass By Reference/Value
- Polymorphism
- Random Values in a Range
    - Inclusive at the end: `Min + (int)(Math.random() * ((Max - Min) + 1))`
    - Exclusive at the end: `Min + (Math.random() * (Max - Min))`


### Yellow Topics (Topics Needing Minimal Review):

- String Manipulation
- Arrays/2D Array Methods
- Iteration (Enhanced For Loops)
